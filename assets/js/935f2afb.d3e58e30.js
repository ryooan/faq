However, prediction markets generally operate using real or virtual currency, which is used to buy and sell shares in \\"event occurrence.\\" The idea is that people buy (or sell) shares if they think that the standing prices reflect too low (or high) a probability in that event. Metaculus, in contrast, directly solicits predicted probabilities from its users, then aggregates those probabilities. We believe that this sort of \\"prediction aggregator\\" has both advantages and disadvantages relative to a prediction market.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"basics/platform":{"id":"basics/platform","title":"The Metaculus Platform","description":"Metaculus is an online forecasting platform and aggregation engine that brings together a global reasoning community and keeps score for thousands of forecasters, delivering machine learning-optimized aggregate forecasts on topics of global importance.

Forecasters make their predictions on these questions, and once the questions are resolved, the forecasters are scored and ranked based on their accuracy. The top ranked forecasters can then receive payouts from a prize pool set aside for the tournament (in addition to other rewards like Metaculus hoodies), as well as the recognition that comes from winning the tournament.
