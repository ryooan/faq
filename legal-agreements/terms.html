Accordingly, you agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that relates to or arises out of the Terms of Use or the Service or your use of the Service (a &quot;<strong>Claim</strong>&quot;) in accordance with the subsections below.</p><p>General. You and Metaculus agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof (collectively, &quot;<strong>Disputes</strong>&quot;) will be settled by binding arbitration; except that either party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court. <strong>You acknowledge and agree that you and Metaculus are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</strong> Further, unless both you and Metaculus otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#x27;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this &quot;Legal Disputes&quot; section will be deemed void. This &quot;Legal Disputes&quot; section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&#x27;s intellectual property or proprietary rights or breach of the User Content and Activities provisions of this Agreement.</p><p>Arbitration Rules, Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;<strong>AAA</strong>&quot;) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the &quot;<strong>AAA Rules</strong>&quot;) then in effect, except as modified by this Section of these Terms of Use. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/Rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.adr.org/Rules</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action taken in a small claims court as contemplated by these terms will be the courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p><p>Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_3.pdf</a> and a separate affidavit for California residents at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Waiver_of_Fees_CA_Only.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Waiver_of_Fees_CA_Only.pdf</a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA&#x27;s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p><p>Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Metaculus otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Metaculus submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p><p>Arbitrator&#x27;s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator&#x27;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator&#x27;s award damages must be consistent with the terms of Limitation of Liability section of these Terms of Use as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&#x27;s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&#x27; fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Metaculus will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys&#x27; fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p><p>Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Metaculus will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p><p>Changes.
