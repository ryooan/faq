focus on tangible, objective facts about the world which are well-defined and not a matter of opinion. “When will the United States collapse?” is a poor, ambiguous question; &quot;<a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8579/us-freedom-in-the-world-score-in-2050/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What will be the US&#x27; score in the Freedom in the World Report for 2050?</a>&quot; is more clear and definite. They generally take the form Will (event) X happen by (date) Y? or When will (event) X occur? or What will the value or quantity of X be by (date) Y?</p><p>A good question will be unambiguously resolvable. A community reading the question terms should be able to agree, before and after the event has occurred, whether the outcome satisfies the question’s terms.</p><p>Questions should also follow some obvious rules:</p><ol><li>Questions should respect privacy and not address the personal lives of non-public figures.</li><li>Questions should not be directly potentially defamatory or generally in bad taste.</li><li>Questions should never aim to predict mortality of individual people or even small groups. In cases of public interest (such as court appointees and political figures), the question should be phrased in other more directly relevant terms such as &quot;when will X no longer serve on the court&quot; or &quot;will Y be unable to run for office on date X&quot;. When the topic is death (or longevity) itself questions should treat people in aggregate or hypothetically.</li><li>More generally, questions should avoid being written in a way that incentivizes illegal or harmful acts — that is, hypothetically, if someone were motivated enough by a Metaculus Question to influence the real world and change the outcome of a question&#x27;s resolution, those actions should not be inherently illegal or harmful.</li></ol><p>Writing incisive questions for forecasting can be challenging, and requires a keen eye for detail, careful precision, creativity and imagination, and a host of other skills. Fortunately, many of these skills can be cultivated with a bit of practice.</p><p>For experienced question writers, we have an <strong><em>interactive checklist - update if not used</em></strong> to address common issues <strong><em>here - add link</em></strong>. For a comprehensive guide to writing good questions, see our guidelines below.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-types-of-questions-are-suitable-for-metaculus">What Types of Questions are Suitable for Metaculus?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-types-of-questions-are-suitable-for-metaculus" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Metaculus hosts questions on almost any topic — science, technology, politics, business, law, economics — you name it! That said, our primary focus areas are Science, <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/what-is-effective-altruism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective Altruism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/cause/healthy-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Health</a>, <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:geopolitics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geopolitics</a>, and <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:category--distant-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Far-Future Forecasting</a> (10 years or more in the future).</p><p>Currently, we will consider any question that satisfies our guidelines and rules for publication on the platform.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="specifying-precise-resolution-criteria">Specifying Precise Resolution Criteria<a class="hash-link" href="#specifying-precise-resolution-criteria" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Resolution criteria are the backbone of any forecasting question—they spell out how and when a question will resolve. It&#x27;s therefore key to spell these out clearly.</p><ol><li><strong>Aim for tight resolution criteria.</strong> The resolution criteria should leave little room for discretion in deciding the resolution. As best you can, try to limit the scope for ex-post quarrels about what really happened, and who was right.</li><li><strong>Define your terms.</strong> Questions of the sort “will X occur?” often hinge on how X is defined. It is therefore important to spell out your definitions with extra care. Don’t worry about being too pedantic here! We also have some <a href="/faq/questions/creating/standard-definitions">commonly specified definitions</a> with Admin-approved language that we suggest you incorporate where applicable.</li><li><strong>Be concrete.</strong> Try to specify precisely and in detail which steps should or shouldn’t be followed when resolving the question. Examples are helpful for making these instructions concrete.</li><li><strong>Use authoritative sources, when possible.</strong> Good options are numerical data regularly published by a reliable publicly available source. Note that you should be sure that the sources will be available at the time of resolution, or otherwise you might want to specify alternative sources of information.</li><li><strong>Consider and account for edge-cases.</strong> Try to imagine scenarios for which the resolution conditions fail to cleanly apply, or cases that are just on the edge of counting towards resolution. If such scenarios or edge-cases are plausible, you should clarify how the question should resolve when such events rear their head.</li><li><strong>Consider fall-back criteria.</strong> When you have a resolution that should be easy to check assuming all goes well, try to handle also the case where all doesn&#x27;t go well. What if the data source you specified stops being published? Is there anything else odd that might happen to make the outcome unclear?</li><li><strong>Try to account for unknown unknowns.</strong> Think about how the resolution criteria behave when something you don’t expect happens anyway.</li><li><strong>Avoid requiring significant Admin effort to resolve.</strong> Questions should not burden Admins with having to do a lot of work to resolve them in the future. Our current policy is to reject any question that would require more than approximately 15 minutes of Admin effort to resolve, unless we judge the question to be important enough to warrant the amount of effort required.</li></ol><p><a href="/faq/question-resolution">See here</a> more details about how questions resolve.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="formatting-and-details">Formatting and Details<a class="hash-link" href="#formatting-and-details" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Metaculus has developed its own style and norms for writing and submitting questions. Heeding these best-practices will be appreciated by Metaculus forecasters and Community Curators alike. Questions which don&#x27;t follow these best-practices may be rejected.</p><ol><li><strong>Write in a neutral and objective tone.</strong> Questions in a neutral point of view represent topics fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias (think Wikipedia-style).</li><li><strong>Put effort into your question submissions.</strong> Don’t expect Curators to develop your question from scratch. If you have early ideas for questions but have yet to work these out, you can add a comment in the <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/956/discussion-topic-what-are-some-suggestions-for-questions-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">question-suggestions discussion post</a>. Questions which are not nearly ready to publish and which do not follow the guidelines on this page will be rejected.</li><li><strong>Keep an eye out for feedback on your questions.</strong> After submitting your question, keep up with the feedback provided by Curators, including requests for revisions.</li><li><strong>Explain why your question is interesting or important.</strong> The significance or context of a question is not always common knowledge, so it is sometimes important to explain it. Quoting predictions from public figures or institutions is a great way to show the significance of a question.</li><li><strong>The title and wording of the question should match the resolution conditions.</strong> Make sure that the question wording and title do not give a mistaken impression of when and how the question might resolve.</li><li><strong>Delegate the boring stuff to the fine-print.</strong> In some cases, the resolution criteria might become quite detailed and involved. To keep questions streamlined, it can be convenient to relegate some of the gory details to the fine-print.</li><li><strong>Select ranges that (likely) contain the resolution value.</strong> For range questions, make sure the bounds cover most possible outcomes, not just all outcomes that appear most likely. Select open bounds if there is even a small chance that values could fall outside the range.</li><li><strong>Avoid excessively wide ranges.</strong> Select a range wide enough that the true value is very unlikely to fall outside, but no wider.</li><li><strong>Double check.</strong> Proof-read your submission, double-check your resolution conditions and ranges, and make sure the formulation of your question is consistent throughout.</li><li><strong>Acknowledge the contributions of others.</strong> When copying text from an existing question, acknowledge and reference the previous question.</li><li><strong>Use appropriate <a href="/faq/markdown">markdown formatting</a>.</strong> When posting URLs, remember to embed these. When writing equations and formulas, try using MathJax.</li><li><strong>Select appropriate category tags.</strong> When submitting a question, make sure that you categorize your question appropriately by selecting relevant tags.</li><li><strong>Specify units and times.</strong> When the question asks about amounts, be sure to specify the units precisely (e.g. thousands of kilograms, nominal US dollars, temperature in degrees celsius). When specifying dates and times, remember to indicate the timezone or a UTC offset, and write all dates following the format “January 1, 2040”.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="question-dates">Question Dates<a class="hash-link" href="#question-dates" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When submitting a question, you are asked to specify the closing date (when the question is no longer available for predicting) and resolution date (when the resolution is expected to occur). The date the question is set live for others to forecast on is known as the open date.</p><ul><li>The <strong>open date</strong> is the date/time when the question is open for predictions. Prior to this time, if the question is active, it will have &quot;upcoming&quot; status, and is potentially subject to change based on feedback. After the open date, changing questions is highly discouraged (as it could change details which are relevant to forecasts that have already been submitted) and such changes are typically noted in the question body and in the comments on the question</li><li>The <strong>close date</strong> is the date/time after which predictions can no longer be updated.</li><li>The <strong>resolution date</strong> is the date when the event being predicted is expected to have definitively occurred (or not). This date lets Metaculus Admins know when the question might be ready for resolution. However, this is often just a guess, and is not binding in any way.</li></ul><p>In some cases, questions must resolve at the resolution date according to the best available information. In such cases, it becomes important to choose the resolution date carefully. Try to set resolution dates that make for interesting and insightful questions! The date or time period the question is asking about must always be explicitly mentioned in the text (for example, “this question resolves as the value of X on January 1, 2040, according to source Y” or “this question resolves as <strong>Yes</strong> if X happens before January 1, 2040)”.</p><p>The close date <em>must</em> be at least one hour prior to the resolution date, but can be much earlier, depending upon the context. Here are some guidelines for specifying the close date:</p><ul><li>If the outcome of the question will very likely or assuredly be determined at a fixed known time, then the closing time should be immediately before this time, and the resolution time just after that.

If your question idea is only interesting to you or a small group of friends, you can make a private question, and share it with them.</li><li><strong>Public questions should not concern the personal lives of non-public figures.</strong> Questions about non-public figures are generally only appropriate as <a href="/faq/questions/types/other#private-questions">private questions</a>.</li><li><strong>Questions should not concern the mortality of individuals.</strong> Questions should never aim to predict mortality of individual people or even small groups. In cases of public interest (such as court appointees and political figures), the question should be phrased in other more directly relevant terms such as &quot;when will X no longer serve on the court&quot;. When the topic is death (or longevity) itself questions should treat people in aggregate or hypothetically.</li><li><strong>Questions should typically not concern harmful acts.</strong> Questions should avoid being written in a way that incentivizes harmful or illicit acts — that is, if one were to imagine that the stakes of getting a question correct were high enough to motivate someone to interfere in real-world events to change a question&#x27;s resolution, those actions should not be by their nature illegal or harmful. Exceptions may be made in cases where such predictions are clearly of wide public interest, which is to be decided by Community Moderators.</li></ul><p>Question content rules (with the exception of the notability requirement, and the no non-public figures rule) apply equally to private questions as they do to public ones.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/faq/questions/creating/overview"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Overview</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/faq/questions/creating/standard-definitions"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Standard Definitions</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#what-types-of-questions-are-suitable-for-metaculus" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What Types of Questions are Suitable for Metaculus?</a></li><li><a href="#specifying-precise-resolution-criteria" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Specifying Precise Resolution Criteria</a></li><li><a href="#formatting-and-details" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Formatting and Details</a></li><li><a href="#question-dates" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Question Dates</a></li><li><a href="#question-content" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Question Content</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div>
