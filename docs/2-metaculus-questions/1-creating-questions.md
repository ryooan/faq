# Creating Questions

## How To Write Good Forecasting Questions

Questions should focus on tangible, objective facts about the world which are well-defined and not a matter of opinion. “When will the United States collapse?” is a poor, ambiguous question; "[What will be the US' score in the Freedom in the World Report for 2050?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8579/us-freedom-in-the-world-score-in-2050/)" is more clear and definite. They generally take the form Will (event) X happen by (date) Y? or When will (event) X occur? or What will the value or quantity of X be by (date) Y?

A good question will be unambiguously resolvable. A community reading the question terms should be able to agree, before and after the event has occurred, whether the outcome satisfies the question’s terms.

Questions should also follow some obvious rules:

1. Questions should respect privacy and not address the personal lives of non-public figures.
2. Questions should not be directly potentially defamatory or generally in bad taste.
3. Questions should never aim to predict mortality of individual people or even small groups. In cases of public interest (such as court appointees and political figures), the question should be phrased in other more directly relevant terms such as "when will X no longer serve on the court" or "will Y be unable to run for office on date X". When the topic is death (or longevity) itself questions should treat people in aggregate or hypothetically.
4. More generally, questions should avoid being written in a way that incentivizes illegal or harmful acts — that is, hypothetically, if someone were motivated enough by a Metaculus Question to influence the real world and change the outcome of a question's resolution, those actions should not be inherently illegal or harmful.


## How A Question Is Created

Many questions are launched by Metaculus staff, but any logged-in user can propose a question. Proposed questions will be reviewed by a group of moderators appointed by Metaculus. Moderators will select the best questions submitted, and help to edit the question to be clear, well-sourced, and [aligned with our writing style](https://www.metaculus.com/question-writing/).

Metaculus hosts questions on [many topics](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/categories/), but our primary focus areas are Science, [Technology](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:tech), [Effective Altruism](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/what-is-effective-altruism/), [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [Health](https://www.metaculus.com/cause/healthy-communities/), [Geopolitics](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:geopolitics), and [Far-Future Forecasting](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:category--distant-future) (10 years or more in the future).


## Editing Permissions

* Admins can edit all questions at any time (however, once predictions have begun, great care is taken not to change a question's resolution terms unless necessary).
* Moderators can edit questions when they are Pending and Upcoming (before predictions have begun).
* Authors can edit their questions when they are Drafts and Pending.



## Creating Your Own Question

1. If you have a basic idea for a question but don’t have time/energy to work out the details, you’re welcome to submit it, discuss it in our [question idea thread](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/956/discussion-topic-what-are-some-suggestions-for-questions-to-launch/), or on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/v2Bf5tppeT).
2. If you have a fully-formed question, with at least a couple of linked references and fairly careful unambiguous resolution criteria, your question has better chances of receiving prompt attention and approval from moderators.
3. Metaculus hosts questions on [many topics](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/categories/), but our primary focus areas are Science, [Technology](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:tech), [Effective Altruism](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/what-is-effective-altruism/), [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [Health](https://www.metaculus.com/cause/healthy-communities/), [Geopolitics](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:geopolitics), and [Far-Future Forecasting](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:category--distant-future) (10 years or more in the future). Questions on other topics, especially that require a lot of moderator effort to get launched, will be given lower priority and may be deferred until a later time.
4. We regard submitted questions as suggestions and take a free hand in editing them. If you’re worried about having your name on a question that is altered from what you submit, or would like to see the question before it’s launched, please note this in the question itself; questions are hidden from public view until they are given “upcoming” status, and can be posted anonymously upon request.


## Getting A Question Approved

We currently receive a large volume of question submissions, many of which are interesting and well-written. That said, we try to approve just enough questions that they each can get the attention they deserve from our forecasters. Metaculus prioritizes questions on Science, [Technology](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:tech), [Effective Altruism](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/what-is-effective-altruism/), [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [Health](https://www.metaculus.com/cause/healthy-communities/), [Geopolitics](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:geopolitics), and [Far-Future Forecasting](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:category--distant-future) (10 years or more in the future); if your question falls into one of these categories and has not been reviewed by moderators after a week or two, or is otherwise very urgent or important, you can tag us with @moderators to get our attention.

## Private Questions

Private questions are questions that are not visible to the broader community. They aren't subject to the normal review process, so you can create one and predict on it right away. You can resolve your own private questions at any time, but points for private predictions won't be added to your overall Metaculus score and they won't affect your ranking on the leaderboard.

You can use private questions for anything you want. Use them as practice to calibrate your predictions before playing for points, create a question series on a niche topic, or pose personal questions that only you can resolve. You can even invite up to 19 other users to view and predict on your own questions!

To invite other forecasters to your private question, click the '...' more options menu and select 'Share Private Question'.

## Discussion Posts

Discussion posts are spaces where discussions can happen on topics that may be beyond the scope of any one forecasting question. They can be useful places for the community to have discussions when no other space is available, or for the Metaculus Team to communicate to the users (and vice-versa). Before creating a discussion post see if your topic would be better suited as a comment on an existing discussion post. In general these are used sparingly and limited to important topics, and must be approved by moderators after they’re submitted.
