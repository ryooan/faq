# Commenting Rules and Guidelines

We have a full set of [community etiquette guidelines](https://www.metaculus.com/help/guidelines/) but in summary:

* Users are welcome to comment on any question.
* Comments and questions can use [markdown formatting](https://www.metaculus.com/help/markdown/)
* Metaculus aims at a high level of discourse. Comments should be on topic, relevant and interesting. Comments should not only state the authorâ€™s opinion (with the exception of quantified predictions). Comments which are spammy, aggressive, profane, offensive, derogatory, or harassing are not tolerated, as well as those that are explicitly commercial advertising or those that are in some way unlawful. See the Metaculus [terms of use](https://www.metaculus.com/terms-of-use/) for more
* You can ping other users using "@username", which will send that user a notification (if they set that option in their notification settings).
* You are invited to upvote questions which contain relevant information to the question, and downvote questions which do not follow our [etiquette guidelines](https://www.metaculus.com/help/guidelines/). Downvotes should not be used for opinions you disagree with (instead, write a comment explaining why you disagree!)
* If a comment is spam, inappropriate/offensive, or flagrantly breaks our rules, please send us a report (under the "..." menu).
