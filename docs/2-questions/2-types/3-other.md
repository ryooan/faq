## Private Questions

Private questions are questions that are not visible to the broader community. They aren't subject to the normal review process, so you can create one and predict on it right away. You can resolve your own private questions at any time, but points for private predictions won't be added to your overall Metaculus score and they won't affect your ranking on the leaderboard.

You can use private questions for anything you want. Use them as practice to calibrate your predictions before playing for points, create a question series on a niche topic, or pose personal questions that only you can resolve. You can even invite up to 19 other users to view and predict on your own questions!

To invite other forecasters to your private question, click the '...' more options menu and select 'Share Private Question'.

## Discussion Posts

Discussion posts are spaces where discussions can happen on topics that may be beyond the scope of any one forecasting question. They can be useful places for the community to have discussions when no other space is available, or for the Metaculus Team to communicate to the users (and vice-versa). Before creating a discussion post see if your topic would be better suited as a comment on an existing discussion post. In general these are used sparingly and limited to important topics, and must be approved by moderators after theyâ€™re submitted.
