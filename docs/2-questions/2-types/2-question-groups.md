# Question Groups

Question groups are sets of closely related questions or question outcomes all collected on a single page. Forecasters can predict quickly and efficiently on these interconnected outcomes, confident that they are keeping all of their predictions internally consistent. Question groups can contain either [binary or range](/questions/types/binary-and-range) type questions.

## The Benefit of Groups

With numeric range question groups, it's easy to forecast progressively wider distributions the further into the future you predict to reflect increasing uncertainty. A question group collecting multiple binary questions on a limited set of outcomes or on mutually exclusive outcomes makes it easier to see which forecasts are in tension with each other.

## Merging Existing Questions

When regular forecast questions are converted into "sub-questions" of a question group, the original pages are replaced by a single question group page. Comments that previously lived on the individual question pages are moved to the comment section of the newly created group page with a note indicating the move.

## Forecasting Sub-Questions

Question groups comprise multiple independent sub-questions. For that reason, there is no requirement that you forecast on every outcome within a group. You may forecast on as few or as many sub-questions as you like.

## Question Group Scoring

Each outcome or sub-question is scored in the same manner as a normal independent question.
