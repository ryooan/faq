# Admins

Metaculus Administrators, or Admins, are [Metaculus employees](https://www.metaculus.com/about/) who interact with and maintain the site to keep it running smoothly. Admins are solely responsible for [moderation](/etiquette/moderation) and imposition of [sanctions](/etiquette/moderation#sanctions), as well as having sole authority to [resolve questions](/question-resolution). Just like the [Community Curators](/etiquette/curators), Admins may also edit, approve, and reject submitted questions. If something needs the attention of Admins they can be notified using the @admins tag.

Only Admins may resolve questions. [Community Curators](/etiquette/curators), question authors, and other users do **not** have the power to resolve questions.
