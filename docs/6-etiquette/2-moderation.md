# Moderation

The [community etiquette guidelines](/etiquette/guidelines) describe the culture of rational and evidence-based discourse we cultivate on the Metaculus platform. We hope that you'll adhere to the guidelines, and we  may [sanction](#sanctions) users who consistently flout them. But we have some rules which we expect all users to follow, and we will [sanction](#sanctions) any user or content that violates these rules. 

## Moderation Rules

1.  **Do not engage in abusive behavior.** Abusive behavior includes personal attacks, making threats, and harassment.
2.  **Do not post or link to any inappropriate, offensive or illegal material.** Please refrain from posting content that is blatantly disruptive to the discussion.
3.  **Do not be intolerant of others.** Intolerance of a person’s race, culture, appearance, gender, sexual preference, religion or age is unacceptable.
4.  **Skip advertisements and spam.** Linking to relevant resources is fine, but promoting products and commercial offerings is not.
5.  **Don't impersonate others.** If a user claims to be someone they are not in comments or in their username, Admins may ask the user to provide identifying information, and remove the misrepresentation if the user cannot verify their identity.
6.  **If you’ve found something wrong, please don’t jeopardize platform functionality.** We’re constantly working on the Metaculus platform. If you have found a bug or if something isn’t working right, we appreciate you letting us know via <a class="link-button" ng-click="modals.setActive('contact-form')">this form</a>.

For further details about our Acceptable Use Policy, check out our [Terms of Use](/terms).

## Sanctions

1.  **Flagging of Comments or Questions.** Content that breaches the [Moderation Rules](#moderation-rules) will be flagged and the user warned or otherwise sanctioned.
2.  **Temporary Suspension.** Participants who flout the Moderation Rules will have access to their account suspended for a period of one week.
3.  **Permanent Ban.** Participants who repeatedly violate the Moderation Rules will have their access to their account permanently blocked.
