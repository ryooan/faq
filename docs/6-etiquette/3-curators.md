# Question Curators

Metaculus Question Curators are committed members of the community who volunteer to help the platform run smoothly. We greatly appreciate their time and talents, and we hope you’ll do the same!

The main responsibilities of Question Curators include:

1.  Providing constructive feedback on user-submitted questions, including asking for revisions when necessary.
2.  Accepting community-suggested questions that are ready to go live for forecasting.
3.  Mediating discussions about question resolutions.
4.  Answering users’ questions about how the platform works, when they arise.

Additionally, Question Curators can help draw extra attention to bugs, feature requests, or other issues that affect the platform. Question Curators are appointed democratically, by way of election. If you’d like to register interest in becoming a Question Curator, please do so by commenting on a recent [Question Curator election post](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=cat:metaculus--community-elections), and we’ll reach out to you before the next election takes place.

If something needs the attention of Question Curators they can be notified using the ***@moderators - update?*** tag.

:::info

Previously the Metaculus Question Curators were known as Community Moderators. We have since changed their title from Moderator to Curator, to reflect the fact that their primary function is to help the community write and publish interesting and high-quality forecasting questions. We are grateful that the Metaculus community exemplifies the [guidelines](/etiquette/guidelines) we set forth, so that all comments which violate our [moderation rules](/etiquette/moderation#moderation-rules) are handled by [Metaculus Admins]((/etiquette/admins)). If you see a comment that violates our rules please report it!

Curators are **not** able to resolve questions. Only [Admins](/etiquette/admins) can resolve questions.
