# Spreading the Word About Metaculus

The more predictors Metaculus has, the more fun and the more interesting it will become. We encourage participants to spread the word to people who they think may enjoy predicting, or who might just be interested in seeing the communityâ€™s forecasts. Some of the most useful ways to share are:

1. Post particular questions you like to Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, using the "share" button on each page, which sets up a default tweet/post that you can edit.
2. [Follow us on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/metaculus/), then retweet Metaculus tweets to your followers.
3. [Follow our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/metaculus/), and share posts you like.
4. Contact us for other ideas.
