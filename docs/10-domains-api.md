# Domains and API

## Metaculus Domains

Metaculus has a domain system, where each domain (like "example.metaculus.com") has a subset of questions and users that are assigned to it. Each question has a set of domains it is posted on, and each user has a set of domains they are a member of. Thus a domain is a flexible way of creating a particular set of questions that are private to a set of users, while allowing some questions in the domain to be posted also to metaculus.com. Domains are a product that Metaculus can provide with various levels of support for a fee; please get in touch for more details.

## API

The Metaculus API can be found here: [https://www.metaculus.com/api2/](https://www.metaculus.com/api2/)

Currently the API is not officially supported, though we intend to release an improved API at some point in the future.
