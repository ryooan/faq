# Metaculus Pro Forecasters

For certain projects Metaculus employs Pro Forecasters who have demonstrated excellent forecasting ability and who have a history of clearly describing their rationales. Pros forecast on private and public sets of questions to produce well-calibrated forecasts and descriptive rationales for our partners. We primarily recruit members of the Metaculus community with the best track records for our Pro team, but forecasters who have demonstrated excellent forecasting ability elsewhere may be considered as well.

If youâ€™re interested in hiring Metaculus Pro Forecasters for a project, contact us at [support@metaculus.com](mailto:support@metaculus.com) with the subject "Project Inquiry".

1. Have scores in the top 2% of all Metaculus forecasters.
2. Have forecasted on a minimum of 75+ questions that have been resolved.
3. Have experience forecasting for a year or more.
4. Have forecasted across multiple subject areas.
5. Have a history of providing commentary explaining their forecasts.
