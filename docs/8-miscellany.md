## Metaculus Pro Forecasters

For certain projects Metaculus employs Pro Forecasters who have demonstrated excellent forecasting ability and who have a history of clearly describing their rationales. Pros forecast on private and public sets of questions to produce well-calibrated forecasts and descriptive rationales for our partners. We primarily recruit members of the Metaculus community with the best track records for our Pro team, but forecasters who have demonstrated excellent forecasting ability elsewhere may be considered as well.

If you’re interested in hiring Metaculus Pro Forecasters for a project, contact us at [support@metaculus.com](mailto:support@metaculus.com) with the subject "Project Inquiry".

Metaculus selects individuals according to the following criteria:

1. Have scores in the top 2% of all Metaculus forecasters.
2. Have forecasted on a minimum of 75+ questions that have been resolved.
3. Have experience forecasting for a year or more.
4. Have forecasted across multiple subject areas.
5. Have a history of providing commentary explaining their forecasts.

## Tachyons

A tachyon is a particle that [can go back in time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyon). On Metaculus, tachyons power users' special retrocausal abilities and allow for the purchase of new abilities—such as unmaking predictions, or revealing the Metaculus Prediction before a question closes. Every week you can collect 10 tachyons by logging in, up to a maximum of 50. You can also earn tachyons as a bonus for reaching achievements, such as “Evangelist” or “Beating the Crowd.” You’ll receive 5, 10, and 50 tachyon bonuses as you reach the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd ranks of an achievement.

## Tachyonic Powers

Powers can be unlocked by attaining the requisite level, or you can pay a premium to get access to a power early. Unlocking a power costs 10 times the sum of the levels between your current level and the unlock requirement level. So if you’re level 4 and the unlock level is 6, the unlock cost would be 10*(5+6) or 110 tachyons.

The current powers, their levels, and their tachyon prices are:

* **View your personal track record timeline:** Every user starts with this. View a timeline showing all of the predictions you’ve made on resolved questions.
* **Set Question Reminders:** For a small cost in tachyons, you can recieve an email notification for a few triggers: when the Community Prediction changes significantly, when new comments are posted, when a question is due to resolve, or on a selected date of your choosing.
* **Hide the Community Prediction:** Requires Level 2. If you prefer not to be influenced by the community’s forecasts, you can hide their predictions either on specific questions or on all questions.
* **View personal track record histograms:** Requires Level 3. This provides another window into your performance, making it especially easy to see if your scores are consistent or dominated by outliers.
* **Add calibration plot to track record:** Requires Level 4. This adds calibration plots to your track record, allowing you to check whether you’re overcautious or overconfident.
* **Access the Metaculus Prediction:** –50 tachyons. Requires Level 5. This lets you see the Metaculus Prediction for that question prior to its closing. Be forewarned, once you use this, you’ll be unable to predict on that particular outcome.
* **See other players’ track records:** –50 tachyons. Requires Level 6. With this power you can peek at another player’s prediction history. But, you must pay for the privilege each time, and the access expires after 24 hours. Users may opt out of making their track records available to others.

Tachyons costs are subject to change in the future.

## Achievements

Each achievement has three ranks. Below are the criteria for moving up through each achievement’s ranks.

* Predictor: Make predictions on many different questions
* In the Black: Earn a large number of points on a single question
* Talkative: Make lots of comments
* Likeable: Make comments that get liked by others
* Engaged: Update predictions multiple times on the same question
* Evangelist: Share links to Metaculus with others
* Beating the Crowd: Successfully predict a question’s resolution more accurately than the community (specifically, the ratio of your probability/density to the community probability/density at close time exceeds a threshold)
* Viral Vector: Share links to Metaculus that get others to sign up
* Private Predictor: Predict on and resolve your own private questions

## API

The Metaculus API can be found here: [https://www.metaculus.com/api2/](https://www.metaculus.com/api2/)

Currently the API is not officially supported, though we intend to release an improved API at some point in the future.


## Changing a Username

You can change your name for free within the first three days of registering. After that it will cost you 15 tachyons. Note that after you change your name, you’ll be unable to change it again for 180 days.

## New User Probation

In an effort to reduce spam, new users must wait 12 hours after signup before commenting is unlocked. Additionally, level one users are unable to downvote comments.

## Account Suspensions

Metaculus may—though this thankfully occurs very rarely—temporarily suspend an account. This occurs when a user has acted in a way that we consider inappropriate, such as when our [terms of use](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/%E2%80%9D/terms-of-use/%E2%80%9D) are violated. At this point, the user will receive a notice about the suspension, and be made aware that continuing this behavior is unacceptable. Temporary suspensions serve as a warning to users that they are a few infractions away from receiving a permanent ban on their account.

## Visibility of the CP and MP

When a question first opens, nobody can see the Community Prediction for a while, to avoid giving inordinate weight to the very first predictions, which may "ground" or bias later ones. The Metaculus Prediction is hidden until the question closes, though it may be peeked at using tachyons.

## NewsMatch

NewsMatch displays a selection of articles relevant to the current Metaculus question. These serve as an additional resource for forecasters as they discuss and predict on the question. Each article is listed with its source and its publication date. Clicking an article title navigates to the article itself. Clicking the ‘rate’ button allows you to indicate whether the article was helpful or not. Your input improves the accuracy and the usefulness of the model that matches articles to Metaculus questions.

The article matching model is supported by [Improve the News](https://www.improvethenews.org/), a news aggregator developed by a group of researchers at MIT. Designed to give readers more control over their news consumption, Improve the News helps readers stay informed while encountering a wider variety of viewpoints.

Articles in ITN's database are matched with relevant Metaculus questions by a transformer-based machine learning model trained to map semantically similar passages to regions in "embedding space." And the embeddings themselves are generated using [MPNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09297). Once a match is made, it must still be manually approved before it can appear alongside a forecast question.

## Metaculus Domains

Metaculus has a domain system, where each domain (like "example.metaculus.com") has a subset of questions and users that are assigned to it. Each question has a set of domains it is posted on, and each user has a set of domains they are a member of. Thus a domain is a flexible way of creating a particular set of questions that are private to a set of users, while allowing some questions in the domain to be posted also to metaculus.com. Domains are a product that Metaculus can provide with various levels of support for a fee; please get in touch for more details.

## Spreading the Word About Metaculus

The more predictors Metaculus has, the more fun and the more interesting it will become. We encourage participants to spread the word to people who they think may enjoy predicting, or who might just be interested in seeing the community’s forecasts. Some of the most useful ways to share are:

1. Post particular questions you like to Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, using the "share" button on each page, which sets up a default tweet/post that you can edit.
2. [Follow us on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/metaculus/), then retweet Metaculus tweets to your followers.
3. [Follow our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/metaculus/), and share posts you like.
4. Contact us for other ideas.
