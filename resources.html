Guesstimate&#x27;s interface is similar to other spreadsheet tools, such as Excel or Google Sheets. Each model is a grid of cells, and each cell can be filled with a name and value. Functions can be used to connect cells together to represent more complex quantities.  </p><p>For example, consider the <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">question series</a> about the Fermi paradox. We may use the Drake equation (a &quot;back of the envelope&quot; estimation to find out if there is intelligent life in the Milky Way other than us humans) to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in our milky verse based on 7 different variables (see<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drake equation</a>). Each guess has its own uncertainties, and with Guesstimate you can multiply the guesses and their uncertainties together to get a probability distribution of the number of intelligent civilizations. See the following <a href="https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/2734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">model by a Guesstimate user on this probability</a>.

Spreadsheets offer similar options to Guesstimate, as you can create theoretical models to factorize questions, produce estimates for subquestions, and run basic Monte Carlo simulations (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb63swYetzY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for an example of such simulation). Secondly, basic statistical analysis (descriptive statistics, correlations, regressions and so on) is convenient in Excel (see <a href="https://ire.org/media/uploads/car2013_tipsheets/excel_stats_nicar2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for more information).

Generally overconfidence leads people to:  </li></ul><ol><li><p>neglect decision aids or other assistance, thereby increasing the likelihood of a poor decision. In experimental studies of postdiction in which each were provided decision aids, subject-level expertise (and thereby confidence) was found to be correlated with lower levels of use of reliable decision aids, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-306-47630-3_22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worse predictions overall</a>.</p></li><li><p>make predictions contrary to the base rate. The base rate is the prevalence of a condition in the population under investigation. To expect the future to be substantially different from the past, one must have good evidence that i) some process crucial to bringing the usual result about will fail, and ii) the replacement process will produce a different outcome. Bayes rule teaches us that to predict unlikely events we must have highly diagnostic information (information that you&#x27;d be unlikely to observe in the usual case) whilst often predictors rely on their confidence rather than diagnosticity of evidence in going against the base rate.</p><p>To counteract overconfidence forecasters should heed <strong>five principles</strong>: <strong>(1)</strong> Consider alternatives, especially in novel or unprecedented situations for which data is lacking; <strong>(2)</strong> List reasons why the forecast might be wrong; <strong>(3)</strong> In group interaction, appoint a devil’s advocate (or play the devil&#x27;s advocate in the comment section!); <strong>(4)</strong> Obtain feedback about predictions (by posting it in the comments for example); <strong>(5)</strong> Treat the feedback you receive as valuable information.</p></li></ol><ul><li><p><strong>Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems.</strong> This is Fermi-style thinking. Enrico Fermi designed the first atomic reactor. When he wasn’t doing that he loved to tackle challenging questions such as “How many piano tuners are in Chicago?” At first glance, this seems very difficult. Fermi started by decomposing the problem into smaller parts and putting them into the buckets of knowable and unknowable. By working at a problem this way you expose what you don’t know or, as Tetlock (2016) puts it, you “flush ignorance into the open.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Discover the relevant base rate.</strong> A <em>Metaculus time lord</em> knows that there is nothing truly new under the sun. So, the best of forecasters often conduct creative searches for comparison classes even for seemingly unique events and pose the question: How often do things of this sort happen in situations of this sort? Identify comparison classes for events, and let your predictions be informed by the base-rate of occurrence in this class of events. This is often easier and more effective then it is to understand the event&#x27;s working from first-principles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Combine systematic ‘model-thinking’ approach with an intuition-based approach</strong>. Whilst it might be often good to use systematic ‘model-thinking’ approach that uses explicit theoretical or statistical reasoning, you should generally also use an intuition-based approach to predicting. When these two approaches yield different answers, think carefully about whether your question is the type of question that is better answered with intuitive judgments or with systematic modelling, and combine the two answers accordingly to inform your prediction. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kahneman</a>, intuitive judgements about some subject likely to be accurate only when the following three conditions hold:  </p><ul><li>The relevant subject exhibits a large degree of regularity</li><li>One has had sufficient amount of exposure to this subject to have been able to pick up the relevant regularities</li><li>One has received enough feedback to evaluate previous intuitive judgments</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Look for the errors behind your mistakes.</strong> It’s easy to justify or rationalize your failure. Don’t. Own it and evaluate your track record (both resolution and calibration) and compare this the community track record. You want to learn where you went wrong and determine ways to get better. And don’t just look at failures. Evaluate successes as well so you can determine whether you used reliable techniques for producing forecasts or whether you were just plain lucky. For example, if you have an average log-score above 0.2, this might be evidence of overconfidence; in which case you should follow the tips on counteracting overconfidence presented above.</p></li><li><p><strong>Share your work in the question&#x27;s comments section.</strong> Sharing your theoretical reasoning (such as posting your Guesstimate model), statistical reasoning, information/data sources, or dependencies with others is good practice not just because you’re providing a valuable public good for our understanding of the future, but also because others may supplement your work with additional insight.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-sources">Data Sources<a class="hash-link" href="#data-sources" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="general-data-sources">General Data Sources<a class="hash-link" href="#general-data-sources" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><em>(in no particular order)</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Data Service</th><th>Organization</th><th>Topics</th><th>Size</th><th>Ease of Use</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Data Explorer</a></td><td>Google</td><td>All topics</td><td>Very large<br><br>Public Data Explorer aggregates public data from113 dataset providers (such as international organizations, nationalstatistical offices, non-governmental organizations, and research institutions)</td><td>Very Easy<br><br>This is a good place to start with your searchfor data, since many datasets are available which are often straightforward tofind.
