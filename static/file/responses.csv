1,Not Ready,"Hi @ user, thanks for submitting this question! Unfortunately your question looks like it would require a lot more work to be ready to publish, questions that are submitted for moderator review should be ready or nearly ready to publish based on the author’s best judgement. See our [question writing guide](link) for more details and what we expect from questions that are submitted. I’ve removed this question from the pending queue, if you make improvements and wish for it to be reviewed again just tag myself or moderators and we’d be happy to take another look. Let me know if you have any questions.",User
2,General Introduction,"Hi @ user, thank you for submitting this question. I've taken a look at it and have some responses, which you'll find listed below. Once you've edited the question to address these let me know and I'll take another look at it!",User
3,Background,"* The background material seems very sparse, we typically want to see more background describing the context for the question and any key information that forecasters should know, with links to sources.",User
4,Background Links,* Please provide links in the background using [markdown formatting](https://www.metaculus.com/help/markdown/) to provide sources for any factual claims or quotes used and to give additional context where needed.,User
5,Quote Attribution,"* Some of the background text looks to be copied from another source. Where language from other sources, such as news articles or Wikipedia, are used we also want to attribute it and show that it's a quote, preferably using the [markdown](https://www.metaculus.com/help/markdown/) quote formatting: `>`.",User
6,Dates,"* To avoid confusion between people in different regions we want to spell out dates wherever possible, for example by saying ""January 1, 2040"". Please revise the format of the dates in the question.",Mod
7,Resolution Source,"* All questions need an authoritative resolution source that fits with the information needed to resolve the question. For example, questions that are based on the release of general news often use [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), while questions that are relying on specific or technical data should specify which sources(s) will be used for resolution.",User
8,Resolution Criteria,* The resolution criteria needs to be well-defined and account for all or nearly all possible outcomes. The resolution criteria currently shown is currently underspecified and would lead to ambiguity when resolving the question in some cases.,User
9,Categories,"* All questions should be assigned to at least one category, and to any other categories that might be relevant.",Mod
10,Resolution Date,"* All questions need to resolve and must have an associated date after which the question will resolve specified in the resolution text. The language for this date should typically use ""before [X}"", where [X] is the date when resolution will be determined. [See the documentation for more](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).",User
11,Tone,* Question backgrounds and resolution criteria need to maintain a neutral tone free from the opinions of the author and treating the opinions of anyone referenced or quoted neutrally.,User
12,Close Date,"* The close date should be just prior to the date of resolution or the end of the period in question. Previous guidance specified a closing date 1/3 to 2/3 through the lifetime of the question, but the [scoring rules have changed]() since then and now it is optimal for close dates to be pushed back. For more see this [documentation entry]().",Mod
13,Retroactive Closure,* Retroactive closure is not appropriate for this question. Retroactive closure is only appropriate when the timing of the event has very little to no bearing on the success of the event. For more information see the [documentation entry](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#closers).,User
14,Binary Formatting,"* For binary questions we want the resolution to clearly state under what condtions the question resolves **Yes**, **No**, or **Ambiguous**, and to use that language and formatting nstead of ""positively"" or ""negatively"".",Mod
15,Numeric Range,* The numeric range should be limited to values which have at least some small probability of occurring and the bounds should be appropriately set depending on whether out of bounds resolution is possible.,Mod
16,Date Range,* The date range should be limited to values which have at least some small probability of occurring and the bounds should be appropriately set depending on whether out of bounds resolution is possible.,Mod
17,Question Topic,"Hi @ user, thanks for submitting this question! Unfortunately I think this question is unlikely to be of broad interest to the community. See this [FAQ entry](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#question-submission) for the types of questions Metaculus tends to publish. I’ve removed this question from the pending queue, if you have any other questions you’re interested in feel free to submit them. Let me know if you have any questions.",User
18,Admin Effort,"Hi @ user, thanks for submitting this question! Unfortunately I think this question is likely to require a significant amount of Admin effort (more than ~15 minutes) in order to resolve it, and I don't think the question is important enough to warrant that amount of effort. Can you think of any methods or resolution sources that could be used to reduce the amount of Admin effort involved? If not, I'll have to remove this one from the pending queue.",User
